# PowerAutomate_PowerBI_real-estate-valuations
Live project showcasing my skills in API integration with Power Automate, data transformation with Power Query, and data modeling &amp; reporting with Power BI.  The workflow automatically fetches daily data via Power Automate, stores it in a file, processes and transforms it with Power Query (ETL), and finally loads it into Power BI for reporting.
